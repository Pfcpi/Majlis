- date always removes one day.

- commission: view (route problem (did not understand))
- temoins for pv are the temoins of the cd(in the printpv, voir pv).
- editpv(problem in route(js error, duplicate temoins))
- send a pdf attachement to present members of the pvs created(same temoins causes js error).
